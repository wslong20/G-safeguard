# [ACL 2025 Main] G-Safeguard: A Topology-Guided Security Lens and Treatment on LLM-based Multi-agent Systems

## ðŸ“° News

- ðŸŽ‰ Updates (2025-5-15) G-Safeguard is accepted to ACL 2025 Main!
- ðŸš© Updates (2025-2-26) Initial upload to arXiv [PDF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11127).

## ðŸŒŸ Overview

We introduce **G-Safeguard**, the first security safeguard for LLM-based multi-agent systems. It is a topology-guided security lens and treatment for robust LLM-MAS, which leverages graph neural networks to detect anomalies on the multi-agent utterance graph and employ topological intervention for attack remediation.
